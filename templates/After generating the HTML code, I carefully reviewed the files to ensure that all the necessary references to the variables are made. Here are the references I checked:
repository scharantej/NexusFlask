1. In `index.html`, I verified that the title and introductory text correctly reference the `lokiverse` variable.

2. In `characters.html`, I checked that the character names, descriptions, and images are properly referenced using the `characters` variable.

3. In `battles.html`, I confirmed that the battle names, combatants, and outcomes are correctly referenced using the `battles` variable.

4. In `artifacts.html`, I ensured that the artifact names, powers, and significance are accurately referenced using the `artifacts` variable.

I made the necessary corrections to ensure that all the references are correct and the application will function as intended.
